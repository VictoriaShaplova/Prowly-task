Title:	Use multiselect filter "Price" on "google.com" to search for "prowly"						
Preconditions:	-						
Steps:	1. Go to "google.com" 
	2. In the search bar type ""prowly"" and press Enter 
	3. Click on the "Pricing" filter
	4. Click on the "Per month" filter
	5. Open the first page of Prowly after the sponsored block						
Expected results:	1-3. Search results should include pages with Prowly's pricing information and links to that page "https://prowly.com/pricing/"
			4. Search results should include pages with Prowly's monthly pricing information and links to that page "https://prowly.com/pricing/"
			5. Redirect to "https://prowly.com/pricing/" page						
Actual results:	When the Pricing filter is used alone, the first result page shows 3 prices. However, when the "Per month" filter is also selected, the first result page only shows the price for the Professional Plus Bundle						
Status:	Retest						
Note:	Need to check with a business analyst to see how many prices should be displayed
